To calculate deformations and stresses of structures, \begriff{finite element analysis} is an important and often used method. It divides the structure in several points, calles \begriff{nodes}, and \begriff{elements} between those nodes. 

As the finite element analysis divides a part in very many elements and there are a lot of equations to solve for every node, the finite element analysis was not very popular until the 1950s. With the rise of the computer it was possible to solve thousands of equations in a few minutes. The more the computer was developed, the more programs were developed.
