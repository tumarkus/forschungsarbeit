\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{What is a Robot? What is a Manipulator?}
	At first sight a \begriff{robot} is very similar to a crane for example. Both are made from several \begriff{links} attached serialy with either revolute or prismatic \begriff{joints}, at both the end effector can be placed in any place in the \begriff{workspace} by defining the \begriff{joint parameters} of each individual joint. The only difference between a robot and a \begriff{manipulator} (the crane) is that the manipulator ist controlled by a human and the robot is guided by an program running on a computer.
